Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have completed a decent portion of the project so far. I have been able to randomly generate the 15 contestants into the game and I have completed the coding for three challenges so far. This has gotten the game down to 10 contestants.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

What I still need to do is figure out around 4 more challenges to get contestantsa voted off. This is mainly what I will be working on over the next few days.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had struggled with trying to get the 15 people generated with no repeats, but I eventually figured this out. I am also struggiling to find challenges that are hard enough, but also easy-ish to code.
